## Code

The code folder contains all the python files as well as all the jupyter notebooks. For more information read the corresponding **README.md** file in that directory.

## Data

The data folder.<br>
It currently contains a single zip **data.zip** file which includes the **test.csv** and the **train.csv**.<br>
Open the zip inside that folder in order to execute the programs <br>
All the programs outputs(**the created csvs**) are placed in this folder in order for them to be arranged neatly.<br>
For more information read the corresponding **README.md** file in that directory.
